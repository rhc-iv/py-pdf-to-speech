> A Python app that takes a PDF file as input, then outputs the text of the PDF to speech.

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/rhc-iv/py-pdf-to-speech)

## Usage

- Open and run `main.py` in the editor/IDE of your choice.
- Use the _**Open PDF**_ button to open a file browser and select the PDF file you wish to parse.
- The app will begin the speech operation immediately; you must stop the script to stop the application.

## 📝 To-Do

- Create a _Cancel_ button tied to a function to cease the text-to-speech operation.
